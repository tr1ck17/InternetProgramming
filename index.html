                    Obviously, Artifical Intelligence has surpassed what we could have feasibly imagined just 6 years ago.
                    A personal testament to how powerful it has become is that I used it to design an outline for this very webpage after feeding
                    it my own, and asking for improvements. But using it only for assignments could be a huge waste of its capabilities; perhaps it
                    would best be used in a more creative way...

                            Noemamag.com states this: "Here humans, living organisms; open and evolving; beings that are equipped with intelligence and, thus, with interiority." <br>
                            "There machines, lifeless, mechanical things; closed, determined and deterministic systems devoid of intelligence and interiority."
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Things like art, existence, history, and knowledge, morals, politics, understanding, these are concepts designed to provide us with the understanding of what is means to have human potential.
                            Therefore, everything else can be sufficiently described as a "closed, determined mechanical system"
                            <br>

                            So, the existance of AI, and the resulting philosophical significance of AI models, which are built, technical systems behaving as if intelligent. In this way, they "break the scaffold" of what's desribed above.

                            Using AI to answer moral questions raises more questions than it does answers. For example, when you ask an AI model
                            to align itself with "human values", it can do a multitude of things. 
                            <br><br>
                            One of these things is to ask, "Which values?". Another
                            is to align itself with a specific set of values that is fundamentally supported by a MAJORITY of humans, but not all.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This can lead to confusion, debate, and perhaps even a LACK of clarity when it comes to what is considered good, bad, moral or immoral.

                    The heart of the discussion is how to align AI behavior with human values. Interestingly
                    enough, it seems that the philosphers of old laid the very groundwork for what designed present day AI.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Aristotle worked with formal logic, which evolved into a "structured approach to reasoning", and is a foundation of AI algorithms today.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Hundreds of years later, Descartes began debates about whether machines could ever replace humans in thought and action; he even proposed
                    the idea that some functions of human though could be mechanized.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And Gottfried Leibniz developed the binary system, which as we all know is a core foundation of computers today, and therefore is a core foundation of Artificial Intelligence.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Altogher, it's a strange irony that the same philosophy used to create the foundations of what is AI today, is the same philosophy that AI cannot take a strong stance on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Taking this into consideration, below are some important topics to consider when we discuss the morality of AI, and what it should be.

                    AI forces philosophy to move from abstract questions to real-world designs and policies.
                    By blending ethical theory with practical safeguards, we can shape intelligent systems that
                    respect human dignity, promote fairness, and earn trust.
